Most computer now have another level of IC called cache memory which is positioned logically between cpu and main memory. A cache memory storage capacity is lesser than main memory but faster than main memory. Now why is this so, cache memory is SRAM memory used to store instructions or data that are to be accessed frequently or repeatedly. We have second copy of those instructions or data in cache memory along with address labels containing addresses of the main memory where those instructions or data are originally stored. Now if we will increase the size of cache memory then more data and instructions along with address labels can be stored in cache but the time to fetch the data or instructions will also increase. There will be extra memory required to store additional address labels also. Hence , increase in its size and also the cost.
